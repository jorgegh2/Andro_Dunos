# Andro Dunos

This project is a tribute to the game **_Andro Dunos_**, released in 1992 for the Neo Geo by Visco Corporation.      
We are a team of four students of CITM in terrassa (Catalonia/Spain), and we are Goosebump Games.

In a not too distant future, the humans have been able to develop the necessary technology for the space conquest. However, after years of authentic scientific furor and great advences in that field, the planet Earth has been attacked by a mysterious alien race, which has endangered the future of humanity. Thereupon, humans have build two spaceships called Space Attack: the most powerful weapons ever created, hoping to defeat the alien army and their force its final withdrawal.

## Installation

## History
Andro Dunos was released on June 15 in 1992 by Visco Corporation, a japanese software company founded in 1982 by Akiyama Tetsuo, and distributed by SNK (Shin Nihon Kikaku), a Japanese videogame company founded in 1973 by Eikichi Kawasaki. It was launched for the Neo-Geo home console, which had been developed by SNK. Even though Visco used to develope for Arcades, the NES and the Nintendo 94, nowadays they are not releasing for video consoles anymore.

Originally, Andro Dunos weighted 34 Mb. Thus, being (with Zed Blade) one of the tiniest and most simple shooter games for the Neo Geo. In spite of it's small size, Andro Dunos managed to deliver a complex, difficult and fun to play experience.
