# Andro Dunos
This project is a tribute to the game **_Andro Dunos_**, released in 1992 for the Neo Geo by Visco Corporation.
We are a team of four students of CITM int terrassa (Catalonia/Spain).

In a not too distant future, the humans have been able to develop the necessary technology for the space conquest. However, after years of authentic scientific furor and great advences in that field, the planet Earth has been attacked by a mysterious alien race, which has endangered the future of humanity. Thereupon, humans have build two spaceships called Space Attack: the most powerful weapons ever created, hoping to defeat the alien army and their force its final withdrawal.
