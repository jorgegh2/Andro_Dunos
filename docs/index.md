## History

Andro Dunos was released on June 15 in 1992 by Visco Corporation, a japanese software company founded in 1982 by Akiyama Tetsuo, and distributed by SNK (Shin Nihon Kikaku), a Japanese videogame company founded in 1973 by Eikichi Kawasaki. It was launched for the Neo-Geo home console, which had been developed by SNK. Even though Visco used to develope for Arcades, the NES and the Nintendo 94, nowadays they are not releasing for video consoles anymore.    

Originally, Andro Dunos weighted 34 Mb. Thus, being (with Zed Blade) one of the tiniest and most simple shooter games for the Neo Geo. In spite of it's small size, Andro Dunos managed to deliver a complex, difficult and fun to play experience.
